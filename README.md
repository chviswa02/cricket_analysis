PROJECT TITLE:

A PROJECT ON CRICKET ANALYSIS  BASED ON HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF PLAYERS

# Case Study: Cricket Tournament

A panel wants to select players for an upcoming league match based on their fitness. Players from all significant cricket clubs have participated in a practice match, and their data is collected. Let us now explore NumPy features using the player's data.

 ▶Height of the players is stored as a regular Python list: height_in. The height is expressed in inches.

 ▶Weight of the players is stored as a regular Python list: weight_lb. The weight is expressed in pounds.
